# GettingCleaningDataWeek4
Programming assignment for Week 4

#Import and merge test and train datasets
  Imports the test and train datasets for the data, subjects and activities
  The code then combines the test and train datasets for each of the categories above to create a total dataset
  For example, it will create a total dataset for the data, a total dataset for the subjects and a total dataset for the activities
  The code then merges these datasets to create one big tidy dataset with proper names for the columns

#Keep relevant columns with appropriate names
 The code then only focuses on the mean and standard deviation columns 

#Create a summary dataset 
 The final step is to create a summary dataset that summarizes the measure variables by subject and by activity
 The summary dataset is exported into a text file
